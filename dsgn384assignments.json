What are the environmental impacts of using fresh water to clean the coral versus other options?  Think beyond the idea of “wasting” water, and really consider the lifecycle of that water.  What are the environmental impacts of using an alternate water source, or of re-using the water after washing the coral?  How do you learn about these things in your design process and how do they impact your design options?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPUMA\u003C/strong\u003E – One of the key challenges of this project is the need for global collaboration.  How do you ensure you are truly understanding the perspectives of the global team members?  How do you communicate with the different team members to draw out the information you need, discuss design decisions and tradeoffs, and propose designs, in a way that is both respectful and effective?  How do you incorporate cultural sensitivity in this process?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIllumination\u003C/strong\u003E – The device you create will be used in a medical research setting.  It will help the client if the device allows the research conditions to be as repeatable as possible.  Consider how this relates to design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA).  Although the device is not currently intended to be mass manufactured, how can you incorporate DFMA principles, focusing on the need for repeatability (as opposed to DFMA principles used to reduce assembly costs and time)?   How does this also relate to usability of the device?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEVF to Virtual Reality\u003C/strong\u003E – The context of use for this virtual reality device will have a significant impact on how it is used.  However, your team will have only limited access to understanding this context.  What steps can you take to truly understand the big picture context down to the nuances of a given situation?  For example, how can you develop an understanding of how a typical procedure might compare to emergency use?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESoccer Training\u003C/strong\u003E – Since the training product could be used in a variety of contexts and will likely be subject to impact from a soccer ball, it will need to be robust to these factors.  Consider the journey of the product, including storage, moving it to location, set up, use, take, down, etc.  what are the different conditions it will be subject to?  Which of these are likely to be the most challenging to address?  How will you apply the principles of robust design to address them?\u003C/p\u003E",

What are the environmental impacts of using fresh water to clean the coral versus other options?  Think beyond the idea of “wasting” water, and really consider the lifecycle of that water.  What are the environmental impacts of using an alternate water source, or of re-using the water after washing the coral?  How do you learn about these things in your design process and how do they impact your design options?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPUMA\u003C/strong\u003E – One of the key challenges of this project is the need for global collaboration.  How do you ensure you are truly understanding the perspectives of the global team members?  How do you communicate with the different team members to draw out the information you need, discuss design decisions and tradeoffs, and propose designs, in a way that is both respectful and effective?  How do you incorporate cultural sensitivity in this process?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIllumination\u003C/strong\u003E – The device you create will be used in a medical research setting.  It will help the client if the device allows the research conditions to be as repeatable as possible.  Consider how this relates to design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA).  Although the device is not currently intended to be mass manufactured, how can you incorporate DFMA principles, focusing on the need for repeatability (as opposed to DFMA principles used to reduce assembly costs and time)?   How does this also relate to usability of the device?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEVF to Virtual Reality\u003C/strong\u003E – The context of use for this virtual reality device will have a significant impact on how it is used.  However, your team will have only limited access to understanding this context.  What steps can you take to truly understand the big picture context down to the nuances of a given situation?  For example, how can you develop an understanding of how a typical procedure might compare to emergency use?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESoccer Training\u003C/strong\u003E – Since the training product could be used in a variety of contexts and will likely be subject to impact from a soccer ball, it will need to be robust to these factors.  Consider the journey of the product, including storage, moving it to location, set up, use, take, down, etc.  what are the different conditions it will be subject to?  Which of these are likely to be the most challenging to address?  How will you apply the principles of robust design to address them?\u003C/p\u003E",
